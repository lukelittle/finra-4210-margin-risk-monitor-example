# FINRA Rule 4210: Margin Requirements

## Overview

FINRA Rule 4210 establishes margin requirements for broker-dealers. Understanding this rule is essential for building compliant risk monitoring systems.

**Important**: This document provides educational context. It is not legal advice. Consult qualified compliance professionals for production systems.

## What is Margin?

**Margin** is the equity (cash + securities value) that a customer must maintain in their account relative to the value of securities held.

### Key Terms

- **Long Market Value (LMV)**: Total value of securities owned
- **Equity**: Cash + LMV (simplified; shorts and debits complicate this)
- **Margin Requirement**: Minimum equity required by regulation or firm policy
- **Excess**: Equity - Margin Requirement
- **Margin Deficiency**: When Excess < 0

## Regulation T vs. Maintenance Margin

### Regulation T (Initial Margin)

Set by the Federal Reserve (currently 50% for equities):

```
Initial Requirement = 50% × Purchase Price
```

This applies when opening a new position. The customer must deposit at least 50% of the purchase price.

### Maintenance Margin (FINRA Rule 4210)

After a position is established, FINRA Rule 4210 requires minimum equity:

```
Maintenance Requirement = 25% × Long Market Value
```

**Example**:
- Customer buys $100,000 of stock
- Initial requirement: $50,000 (Reg T)
- Maintenance requirement: $25,000 (FINRA 4210)

If the stock declines and equity falls below $25,000, a margin call is issued.

## House Requirements

Broker-dealers can impose stricter requirements than regulatory minimums. Common house rules:

### 1. Higher Maintenance Rates

Many firms require 30-40% instead of 25%:

```
House Maintenance = 30% × LMV
```

### 2. Concentration Limits

If a single position exceeds a threshold (e.g., 30% of portfolio), add extra margin:

```
If (Position_i / Total_MV) > 30%:
    Additional_Margin = 10% × Position_i
```

**Rationale**: Concentrated positions have idiosyncratic risk not captured by market-wide margin rates.

### 3. Low-Priced Securities

Stocks under $5 may require 100% margin (no leverage):

```
If price < $5:
    Maintenance = 100% × Position_Value
```

### 4. Volatility-Based Adjustments

High-volatility stocks may require higher margin:

```
If 30-day volatility > threshold:
    Maintenance = (25% + volatility_addon) × LMV
```

## Portfolio Margin (Rule 4210(g))

For eligible accounts (typically $100k+ equity, sophisticated investors), portfolio margin uses risk-based requirements instead of fixed percentages.

### Key Differences

| Reg T / Maintenance | Portfolio Margin |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Fixed % of position value | Risk-based scenarios |
| No offset between positions | Offsets for hedged positions |
| Simple calculation | Complex modeling |
| Higher capital requirement | Lower for hedged portfolios |

### Portfolio Margin Calculation

Uses theoretical pricing models to compute worst-case loss across scenarios:

```
Scenarios: Underlying moves ±15% in 10 steps
For each scenario:
    Revalue all positions
    Compute portfolio value
Worst-Case Loss = min(portfolio values) - current value
Requirement = |Worst-Case Loss| × multiplier
```

This is similar to TIMS (see [02-what-is-tims.md](02-what-is-tims.md)).

## Margin Calls and Enforcement

### When a Margin Call Occurs

```
If Equity < Maintenance Requirement:
    Issue Margin Call
```

### Customer Response Options

1. **Deposit Cash**: Increase equity directly
2. **Deposit Securities**: Add marginable securities
3. **Liquidate Positions**: Reduce LMV (and thus requirement)

### Firm Actions

If the customer doesn't respond promptly:

1. **Restriction**: Set account to close-only (no new purchases)
2. **Liquidation**: Firm sells securities to restore compliance

**Important**: The firm is not required to give advance notice before liquidating. This protects the firm from further losses.

## Intraday Monitoring

While Rule 4210 doesn't explicitly require intraday monitoring, prudent risk management demands it:

- Prices change continuously
- Large intraday moves can create deficiencies
- Waiting until end-of-day increases firm risk

Modern systems (like this one) monitor margin in real-time.

## Our Implementation

This system implements:

### 1. Baseline Maintenance Margin

```python
maintenance_rate = 0.25  # 25% FINRA minimum
maintenance_requirement = maintenance_rate * market_value
```

### 2. Concentration Add-On (House Rule)

```python
concentration_threshold = 0.30  # 30% of portfolio
concentration_addon_rate = 0.10  # Additional 10%

for position in portfolio:
    weight = position.value / total_mv
    if weight > concentration_threshold:
        maintenance_requirement += concentration_addon_rate * position.value
```

### 3. Margin Excess Calculation

```python
equity = cash + market_value
excess = equity - maintenance_requirement

if excess < 0:
    margin_deficiency = abs(excess)
    issue_margin_call(account_id, margin_deficiency)
```

### 4. Escalation Ladder

```python
if excess < warning_threshold:
    send_warning(account_id)
elif excess < 0:
    issue_margin_call(account_id)
    if time_since_call > escalation_minutes:
        restrict_account(account_id)  # Close-only
        if still_deficient:
            trigger_liquidation(account_id)
```

## Regulatory Examination

Regulators expect:

1. **Written Policies**: Documented margin requirements and procedures
2. **Monitoring Systems**: Automated detection of deficiencies
3. **Timely Action**: Prompt margin calls and liquidations
4. **Audit Trail**: Records of all margin events and actions taken

Our system produces an immutable audit trail in `audit.v1` topic and S3.

## Key Takeaways

1. **FINRA 4210 sets minimum maintenance margin at 25%**
2. **Firms can and do impose stricter house requirements**
3. **Portfolio margin is risk-based and scenario-driven**
4. **Margin deficiencies require prompt action**
5. **Real-time monitoring is industry best practice**
6. **Audit trails are essential for regulatory compliance**
